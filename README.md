# Antennas!

This repo has information on antennas for PSAS launch vehicles, including linearly polarized cylindrical patch antennas (CPAs).

## Current Work:

We're currently using the CPA v4 antennas on LV2.1 for 2015.

With LV3's carbon fiber airframe targeted for 2015/2016, we're once again contemplating good ways to put antennas on rockets. Our current favorite design seems to be integrating our cylindrical patch antennas directly into a short fiberglass-based composite module.
